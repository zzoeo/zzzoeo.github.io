                <p>When I was considering options for pages that might have well designed mobile sites, Adobe was an obvious one that came to mind, and they didn’t disappoint. While their site displays many design principles, I think the homepage is a great example of White Space and Clean Design. I love the openness of the design and how much white space is left on the page. In my opinion, most mobile sites struggle with clean design because they are attempting to cram all the information from a desktop site into a much smaller format, and it ends up being overwhelming. Adobe, however, took a different approach, and the clean-cut, breathable simplicity is refreshing.</p>

                <p>H&M</p>
                <a href="https://www2.hm.com/en_us/index.html">hm.com</a>
                <img id="hm" src="lesson2/images/hm.jpg" alt="hm home page">
                <p>While browsing the H&M mobile site, I was really impressed by the design of the categories list on the homepage. I think it is a great example of powerful repetition that creates a fresh and unique categories list. While the images are different, they are formatted the same way to create a repetitive effect. The result is a cohesive, consistent list of categories that is well designed and catches the eye.</p>

                <p>This page on tjmaxx’s site is a nice example of alignment and repetition working together. The repeated boxes are clearly defined and organized by their uniform alignment. This is very satisfying to the eye, and creates balance on the page. I think it was wise to keep the menu simple and clean-cut in order to offset everything else going on within the page. </p>
